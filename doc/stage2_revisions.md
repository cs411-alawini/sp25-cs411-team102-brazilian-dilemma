- Fixed UML diagram according to feedback given on Stage 2 grading and new ideas:
  - Booking was made a relationship between Passenger and Flight
  - Airline table was removed for being unnecessary
  - Status-Flight relationship was flipped
  - Fixed variable types and added attributes where it was deemed necessary
- Updated assumptions, relational schema, and cardinality to match updated UML diagram
